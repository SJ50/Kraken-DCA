# Kraken-DCA
- This project is used to automatically buy a set amount of BTC at set intervals (e.g. daily), using Kraken exchange API endpoints
- 90% reduction in trading fees as compared to using the built-in recurring purchase feature in the Kraken mobile app
  - Use limit-orders because this comes with lower fees than market orders
